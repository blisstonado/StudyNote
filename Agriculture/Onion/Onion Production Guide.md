1. Module 1: 
    1.  Site Selection
  1. Water source: near river
  2. Type of soil: sandy loam 砂质土壤
  3. Elevation 海拔:  The area must not be prone to flooding, You can plant in a rice field but not in a low lying area where the water will be stagnant. You can plant in flat land or rolling hills. You can plant in a corn field or vegetable field, It must be an open area with no trees and free of grass.
  4. Planting Season: The planting season starts at the end of the rainy season. September in Pangasinan, October-November in Nueva Ecija and November-December in Mindoro and Visayaz
2. Seedling Management
  1. Seed bed preparation:  East-West Seed for seed bed preparation Prepare 1000 sqm of a hectare of land, this will be the seed bed. Even before the seed bed preparation starts, solarizing must be conducted. The drying and tilling of soil. This is done to promote fixation of natural elements in the soil. 这样做是为了促进土壤中自然元素的固定。Seed bed preparation is done in a week, starting with flooding. Break up the soil through 1) Plowing 犁地 2) Harrowing 耙地. Make a flat bed that is 0.8-1m wide 制作一张0.8-1m宽的平床, and 15-20cm long. Bed: 0.8-1m LAPAD AT 15-20CM TAAS. This is the appropriate distance for healthy and resilient seedlings 有弹性的幼苗. Apply 200kg organic manure and 40kg 14-14-14 to the seed bed. Organic manure will help keep the soil loose. The inorganic fertilizer will be readily available nutrients for the early emergence of roots and leaves 无机肥将是根和叶早期出苗的现成养分.
  2. Seed Sowing 播种(Day 1) Do this when there is no expected rainfall in the next 2 weeks. Sow 5kg of Red Pinoy or Super Pinoy, Place the seeds within the grooves and cover with 1cm soil 将种子放在凹槽内并覆盖1厘米的土壤.
  3. Apply insecticide for ants and other insects Aside from liquid insecticide, you can also use granular insecticide 颗粒杀虫剂 which has a longer effectiveness.  Cover the seed bed with rice straw, rice straw will serve as protection against heavy rain. It will also keep the soil from hardening 硬化. It maintains the humidity and moisture of the soil which helps the germination 发芽 of seeds.  After that, water and seed bed. Do this in the morning and afternoon for 7 days. Sufficient moisture in the soil is important for the seeds to grow well.
  4. Removal of mulching 去除覆盖物 (Day 7) Remove the rice straw after 7 days, By now the seedlings would have germinated by 70%. Remove the rice straw now, so that the leaves won’t cling onto them 现在把稻草移开，这样叶子就不会粘在上面了. and so that seedings could continue to grow. Water using a sprinkler for 15 days.
  5. Irrigation, Spraying and Weeding (Day 15) Then, do farrow irrigation 分娩灌溉 after 15 days. Apply fungicide and insecticide only when needed 仅在需要时使用杀菌剂和杀虫剂. Proplant or previcur N are fungicides. Applied once a week 每周一次, when there is a sign of damping off 阻尼迹象. Unnecessary, frequent use could kill your plants. Practice weeding, there must be no grass on the seed bed within 30 days.
  6. Herbicide Application 除草剂的应用 (Day 20) After 20 days, spray herbicide if weeds, like narrow leaf, are growing.
  7. Fertilization (Day 15-23) Apply 5kgs 14-14-14 on the 1000 sqm seed bed.
  8. Hardening (Days 30-37) Hardening is done 5-7 days before transplanting. To make the seedling strong enough for transplanting. A hardened seedling is round and solid 硬化的幼苗是圆形且坚固的. Seedlings must be accustomed to no water for a week 幼苗必须习惯一周不浇水. When it’s strong enough, the seedling will turn dark green.
  9. Seedling preparation (Day 40-45) Water the seedlings using a sprinkler a day before, for easier uprooting.  Remove the excess 多余的 roots.  
2. Module 2:
  1. Area preparation Area preparation and Seedling Management are done at the same time.  The same activities are done for both areas: e.g. solarizing and flooding… germination and weeding… ploughing and harrowing…
    1. Planting Bed Preparation (Day 15) Make a planting bed 15-20cm in height and 30cm wide.
    2. Basal fertilization: Inorganic fertilizer (Day 17) Apply 6 bags of 14-14-14 and 2 bags of 46-0-0, Plow and harrow to incorporate the fertilizer into the soil
    3. Basal fertilization: Organic (Day 25) Apply 20 bags of organic fertilizer for a hectare of land.
    4. Lay-Outing (Day 30) Each region has a different planting layout.
  2. Direct seeding Aside from layout, method of planting is also different in Bayamang, Pangasinan. Here, they do direct seeding, More costly in terms of seeds, but has lots of advantages too 种子成本更高但也很有优势, Like less labor cost, because there’s no transplanting, Faster maturity as well because it won’t have to recover from transplanting 成熟更快，因为它不必从移植中恢复. The bulb also grows better with direct seeding. Since there is a high density of seeds with direct seeding, a hectare will yield more harvest. Harvest is early with direct seeding, Because the supply of onions are low, the prices are high. Other than that, farmers follow the practices in their respective regions 除此之外，农民遵循各自地区的做法. Once the planting beds are made, direct seeding can be conducted via the broadcast method 播种方式.
    1. Broadcast method
      1. Using a seeding machine
  3. Transplanting
    1. Transplanting (Day 41) To transplant, stick the seedings into the soil
  4. Farm management
    1. Irrigation: Vegetative stage 营养阶段 After transplanting, immediately conduct farrow irrigation, do this every 10-14 days, if the soil is dry, it means it’s time for watering. Don’t wait until the root system of the plant dries up.
    2. Spraying: insecticide and fungicide (Day 41) Spray insecticide and fungicide before or after irrigation, do this regularly. Watch out for pests called army worms 注意叫做粘虫的害虫. And the disease, anthracnose 炭疽病.
    3. Spraying: weedicide (Day 42) Use weedicide, like Onecide and Simacor for narrow leaf grass. One Star and Goal for broad leaf grass.
    4. 1ST fertilizer application (Day 44) Always water after fertilization, It will be helpful to conduct soil analysis prior to applying fertilizer. Apply 7 bags of 16-20-0 and 1/2 bag of 0-0-60, per hectare.
    5. 2ND fertilizer application (Day 58) Apply 5 bags of 16-20-0 and 1/2 bag of 0-0-60, per hectare. Then water your field.
    6. 3RD fertilizer application (Day 74) Apply 3 bags of 16-20-0 and 2 bags of 17-0-17 top dress, per hectare.
    7. Irrigation: bulb development (Day 81) during the bulb development, water every 7 days until harvest.
    8. Hand weeding Weed as needed
    9. Other management activities: Hilling up
  5. Direct seeding farm management The same cultural management is done with direct seeding. Thinning, or the removal of excess seedlings, is done as the plant grows 随着植物的生长，稀疏或去除多余的幼苗.
3. Module 3:
  1. Harvesting Red Pinoy & Super Pinoy are ready to harvest when 80% of the leaves. Have fallen within 85-90 days transplanting, 110-120 days for direct seeding. By now, the onions have fully matured. They can also be stored in an open air drier or brought to storage if prices are low.
  2. Post-harvest handling Red Pinoy & Super Pinoy bulbs last 1-2 months in an open air drier, and 7-9 months in a storage facility. Choose the sturdiest bulbs for storage to avoid rotting. When taking the bulb out of storage, clean them and remove the bulbs that have rotted. Sort them according to size too.
  3. Cost and return analysis
    1. Cost per hectare: PHP 70,244 - Seeds and inputs per hectare PHP 84,200 - Labor costs PHP 154,444 - Total cost In Total, PHP 154,444 for 1 hectare
    2. Highest yield per hectare: 25 Tons or 25000 kilos Highest farm gate price: PHP 45.00 Provided that recommended cultural practices of East West Seeds are followed, with the right climate and weather conditions. At its highest, farm gate price of onion per kilo is PHP 45
    3. Gross income per hectare: PHP 1,125,000 Net income per hectare per cropping: PHP 970,556 which means you can earn gross income of PHP 1,125,000 per hectare.Minus the PHP154444 total cost, we are left with php 970,556. Per hectare in 4 months, for Red Pinoy & Super Pinoy
